There have been a few blog posts from around the web talking about how much we'll miss Beall's list now that it has been taken offline. 
But all is not lost!
There is still hope that the conversation that Jeffrey Beall began and singlehandedly supported will live on and grow. 

[Predatory Publishers: Why I’ll Miss Jeffrey Beall](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/neuroskeptic/2017/01/25/publishers-jeffrey-beall/) - January 25, 2017 

The Neuroskeptic blog at Discover Magazine eulogizes Beall's list and calls for a community effort to help lend legitimacy to the effort and avoid accusations of arbitrary and unfair inclusion of journals on the list. The post rightly points out that any such community effort would need careful moderation. 
This site is one such attempt, given that the GitHub platform allows anyone to make suggestions and changes, raise issues, etc.

An essay on predatory and parasitic publishing by Luděk Brož, Tereza Stöckelová, and Filip Vostal from this week raises important concern about the language that we use to discuss these journals and publishers doing harm to academic communities. They suggest that we might think about these ersatz institutions and publication venues as parasitic rather than predatory because they feed on the work of legitimate institutions, scientists, publishers, and journals.

[UGC’s ‘List of Journals’ Will Not By Itself Improve Quality Or Volume of Research](https://thewire.in/103208/ugc-journals-jicpr-vijanakairali/) - Pushkar - January 27, 2017

Two blog posts in The Wire this week talk about the newly-published University Grants Commission (UGC) recommended list of journals. 
This list includes a number of journals that can be considered predatory or otherwise illegitimate. 
The list also ignores major journals in the fields it covers.

Finally, there is another, somewhat tongue-in-cheek site that has resurrected Beall's lists. We heartily support any efforts to keep these lists online. 

What these and other mumblings from around the web suggest is that this sort of engagement is 

1. something that is desperately needed, 
2. something that we are somehow institutionally incapable of coordinating. 

Let's keep the effort going. Please [contribute information and suggestions](/contribute/) to this site and we'll get it online as fast as humanly possible.
